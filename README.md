A proxy for [Glitch](https://glitch.com), since Lexington High School blocks `glitch.me`. 

Usage: `glitch-proxy.now.sh/<subdomain>/<path>` maps to `<subdomain>.glitch.me/<path>`

In order to get the root of the project (`<subdomain>.glitch.me/`), you need to add a trailing slash (`glitch-proxy.now.sh/<subdomain>/`)
